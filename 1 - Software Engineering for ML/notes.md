# Software Engineering for Machine Learning

## Software Engineering foundaments

- The world is dominated by software
- Software is in our car, airplane, our work, phone, etc
- Business and economy are driven by software nowdays
- The biggest companies in the world are software companies (or hardware companies that are driven by software)
- A software is developed to fullfil an specific need/requirements
- **Modularity**: The software is divided in modules, each module is responsible for a specific task
  **Setting management**: The software is divided in layers, each layer is responsible for a specific task
- **Quality Assurance**: The software is tested to ensure that it works as expected, every single software has bugs, but the goal is to minimize them
- **Documentation**: The software is documented to help other developers to understand how it works, the team must know what every module does
- **Maintenance**: The software is maintained to keep it up to date, to fix bugs, to add new features, etc. every thing we have requires maintenance, so does the software
- **Interoperability**: The software is designed to work with other software, to be able to communicate with other software, the software is not an island, it must work with other software
- **Efficiency**: The software is designed to be efficient, to be fast, to use the minimum resources possible, the capacity of the software to use the resources (hardware) efficiently is important
- **Security**: The software is designed to be secure, to protect the data, to protect the users, to protect the system, the security is a must in the software
- **Software development is in fact, an art**
- **SDLC**: Software Development Life Cycle
- Similar with the human life cycle, the software has a life cycle
- **Planning and requirements**: The software is planned, the requirements are defined, the business needs are set
- **System analysis**: What we need to run the software, what are the requirements, what are the constraints, what are the risks, etc
- **Design / Project**: The software is designed, the architecture is defined, the modules are defined, the layers are defined, the database is defined, etc
- **Testing**: The software is tested, the software is validated, the software is verified, the software is checked, the software is debugged
- **Implementation**: The software is implemented, the software is coded, the software is developed, the software is built
- **Maintenance and support**: The software is maintained, the software is updated, the software is fixed, the software is improved, the software is optimized
- **Retirement**: The software is retired, the software is replaced, the software is removed, the software is archived, RIP
- **Version control**: Refers to the management and tracking of changes on a software or a set of files
- This allows different developers to work on the same project, gives traceability, colaboration, reversibility, concurrency, etc
- **Git and GitHub**: Git is a version control system, GitHub is a platform to host Git repositories
- There are other version control systems like SVN, Mercurial, etc, nowdays it's basically impossible to work without a version control system - is funny to think that those systems are also software, the world is really dominated by software
- **There are different types of software testing**:
- **Unit testing**: Testing the smallest unit of the software, the function, the class, the module
- **Integration testing**: Testing the integration between the modules, the layers, the components
- **System testing**: Testing the whole system, the whole software, the whole application
- **Acceptance testing**: Testing the software with the user, the user is the one who will use the software, the user is the one who will benefit from the software
- **Load testing**: Testing the software under load, the software is tested with a lot of users, with a lot of requests, with a lot of data, etc
- **Security testing**: Testing the software for security vulnerabilities, the software is tested to ensure that it's secure
- **Usability testing**: Testing the software for usability, the software is tested to ensure that it's easy to use, that it's user friendly
- **Testing automation**: The tests are automated, being tested by another software
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment - the modern practice of software development, focusing on the continuous integration and continuous deployment of code, delivering the value to the user as fast as possible, continuously
- A **Machine learning model is not a software** by itself, but it can be a part of a software
- A machine learning model is a mathematic representation of a problem, trained to solve a specific problem, as classification, regression, etc
